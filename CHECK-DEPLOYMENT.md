# üîç Deployment Troubleshooting

## Check These Things:

### 1. Vercel Deployment Status
Go to: https://vercel.com/keithlemay85-3936s-projects/iliosauna/deployments
- Check if the latest deployment succeeded
- Look for any build errors
- The last commit should be: "Add enhanced customer dashboard..."

### 2. If Build Failed
Common issues:
- TypeScript errors in the new pages
- Missing imports
- Supabase client issues

### 3. Direct URLs to Test
Try these exact URLs:
- https://iliosauna.com/account (main dashboard)  
- https://iliosauna.com/account/orders (orders list)
- https://iliosauna.com/account/profile (profile page)

### 4. Alternative: Check if Old Site Structure
The live site might still be using the OLD HTML structure, not the Next.js app.
Check if this works instead:
- https://iliosauna.com (main site)

### 5. Local Test Commands
If you want to test locally (Windows terminal):
```bash
cd iliosauna-next
npm install
npm run build
```

If build succeeds locally, the issue is with deployment.
If build fails, we need to fix the errors.

## Quick Fix if Needed:

### Option A: Force Redeploy
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Click on latest deployment
3. Click "Redeploy"

### Option B: Check Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in Vercel:
- NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
- CLERK_SECRET_KEY
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

## The Issue Might Be:
The account pages require authentication. Make sure you're:
1. Signed in at https://iliosauna.com
2. Have a valid session
3. Try signing out and back in
