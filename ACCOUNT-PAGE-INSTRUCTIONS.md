# üîê How to Access Your Account Dashboard

## The account page requires authentication!

### Step 1: Sign In First
1. Go to https://iliosauna.com
2. Click the **Sign In** button (top right)
3. Sign in with your Clerk account
   - If you don't have one, click "Sign Up" and create one

### Step 2: Access Dashboard
After signing in, go to: https://iliosauna.com/account

### Why You Got 404 Error
- The `/account` route is **protected**
- When not signed in, Clerk blocks access
- This is working as intended for security

## Testing Your Dashboard

### Once Signed In, You Can Access:
- **Main Dashboard**: https://iliosauna.com/account
- **Orders List**: https://iliosauna.com/account/orders  
- **Order Details**: Click any order to see timeline

### Your Test Data
After running the SQL script, you have:
- 4 test orders in different stages
- Order timeline visualization
- Installation scheduling feature

## If Still Getting 404 After Sign In:

### Check These:
1. **Clear Browser Cache**
   - Hard refresh: Ctrl + Shift + R
   - Or open in incognito/private window

2. **Verify Deployment**
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/keithlemay85-3936s-projects/iliosauna/deployments
   - Latest deployment should show "Ready"

3. **Check Console for Errors**
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Look for any red errors in Console tab

## The Key Point:
**You MUST be signed in to access /account pages**

This is a security feature, not a bug!
