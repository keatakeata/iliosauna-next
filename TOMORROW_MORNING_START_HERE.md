## 🎯 Priority Tasks for Tomorrow

### 1. **Connect Stripe (HIGHEST PRIORITY)**

# What you need:

2. Get API keys from Stripe Dashboard
3. Add to Vercel environment variables:
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_...
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_...
```

### 2. **Add Content to Sanity CMS**
```bash
# Go to: https://sanity.io/manage/project/bxybmggj
1. Add blog categories: Health, Design, Technical, Lifestyle
2. Create authors (you and any team members)
3. Write first blog posts
4. Add sauna products with prices
```

### 3. **Create Stripe Webhook**
File to create: `src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`
```typescript
// This will automatically create orders when someone pays
import { headers } from 'next/headers';
import Stripe from 'stripe';
import { supabase } from '@/lib/supabase';

const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY!);

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const body = await req.text();
  const signature = headers().get('Stripe-Signature')!;
  
  const event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(
    body,
    signature,
    process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET!
  );
  
  if (event.type === 'checkout.session.completed') {
    const session = event.data.object;
    
    // Create order in Supabase
    await supabase.from('orders').insert({
      clerk_user_id: session.metadata?.userId,
      stripe_payment_intent_id: session.payment_intent,
      total_amount: session.amount_total / 100,
      customer_email: session.customer_email,
      status: 'paid'
    });
  }
  
  return Response.json({ received: true });
}
```

## 💡 Quick Wins for Tomorrow

   - Price: $100 (for testing)
   - This lets you test the full purchase flow

2. **Create Your First Blog Post**
   - Go to Sanity Studio
   - Add a blog post about sauna benefits
   - It will automatically appear on /journal

3. **Test the Account Dashboard**
   - Sign up as a new user
   - Visit /account
   - Familiarize yourself with the layout

## 🆘 If You Get Stuck

### Database Issues
- SQL Editor: https://app.supabase.com/project/tptazvskawowdimgmmkt/sql
- Check table structure: `SELECT * FROM orders LIMIT 1;`

### Deployment Issues
- Check build logs: Vercel Dashboard → Functions → Logs
- Redeploy: Vercel Dashboard → Deployments → Redeploy

### Local Dev Server Issues
- The trace file error is a Windows permission issue
- Alternative: Use the live site for testing
- Or try: `cd iliosauna-next && rm -rf .next && npm run dev`
