# Supabase Setup - What Actually Worked

## ‚ùå What DIDN'T Work (and Why)
1. **Complex multi-column ALTER TABLE statements** - PostgreSQL doesn't support this syntax
2. **INDEX inside CREATE TABLE** - Must be created separately 
3. **CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS** - This syntax doesn't exist in PostgreSQL
4. **Complex RLS policies using auth.uid()** - Doesn't work with Clerk authentication
5. **Overly complex triggers and functions** - Too many moving parts

## ‚úÖ What DID Work
**SIMPLE IS BETTER**. The final working schema just:
- Added one column at a time
- Created basic tables without fancy features
- Skipped complex policies and triggers
- Used straightforward CREATE TABLE statements

## Key Lesson
**Start simple, add complexity later.** Get the basic tables working first, then add features.

1. Browse saunas (Sanity CMS for content)
2. Purchase sauna (Stripe for payment)
3. Order saved (Supabase database)
4. Account created (Clerk for auth)
5. Track order (Supabase data)
6. Get support (Supabase tickets)
```

# Next Steps to Activate Everything

## 1. **Connect Stripe to Supabase**
```javascript
// When Stripe payment succeeds:
const order = await supabase.from('orders').insert({
  clerk_user_id: user.id,
  stripe_payment_intent_id: paymentIntent.id,
  total_amount: amount,
  customer_email: email,
  status: 'paid'
});
```

## 2. **Test the User Dashboard**
- Go to: https://iliosauna.com/account
- Should show the dashboard (currently with no orders)
- Once Stripe is connected, orders will appear

## 3. **Add Test Data (Optional)**
Run this in Supabase to create a test order:
```sql
INSERT INTO orders (
  order_number,
  clerk_user_id,
  customer_email,
  customer_name,
  total_amount,
  status
) VALUES (
  'ILIO-TEST-001',
  'your-clerk-user-id',
  'test@example.com',
  'Test Customer',
  15000.00,
  'processing'
);
```

## 4. **Set Up Stripe Webhooks**
1. Go to Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks
2. Add endpoint: `https://iliosauna.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
3. Listen for: `checkout.session.completed`
4. This will automatically create orders in Supabase

## 5. **What's Still Needed**
- [ ] Stripe API keys in environment variables
- [ ] Create webhook endpoint at `/api/webhooks/stripe`
- [ ] Add products to Stripe dashboard
- [ ] Test a complete purchase flow

---

## Summary
**You now have a working database that can:**
- Store customer orders from Stripe
- Track shipping and installations
- Handle customer support
- Power the user account dashboard

The database is the "memory" of your business - it remembers every order, tracks every shipment, and manages every customer interaction.
